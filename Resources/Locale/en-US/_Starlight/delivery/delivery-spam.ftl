                    {"[bold]NUMBER ONE[/bold]"}
                    THEIR GUNS SUCK! THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE SNIPER RIFLES! THEIR SECURITY FORCES CAN'T EVEN CARRY BIG GUNS IN MOST SITUATIONS!
                    
                    {"[bold]NUMBER TWO[/bold]"}
                    THEIR COMMANDERS? THEY DIE FROM A SINGLE SHOT! NO COOL ARMOR! JUST BANG, DEAD! LAME! OUR COMMANDERS GET COOL HARDSUITS!

                    {"[bold]NUMBER THREE[/bold]"}
                    THEIR MURDER METHODS ARE UNINSPIRED! IT'S JUST GUN! THERE'S NO THROWING PEOPLE INTO DEEP SPACE, NO FEEDING PEOPLE INTO RECYCLERS WITH SAFETY MODE DISENGAGED, NO SLIPPING BOMBS INTO POCKETS! SO BORING!

                    {"[bold]SIGN HERE IF YOU AGREE[/bold]"}
                    glory to the syndicate, death to nanotransen

                                  Look around.
                                  Someone's got the insulated gloves.
                                  Someone's got the captain's spare.
                                  Someone's got a locker full of contraband and cool toys.
                                  
                                  And it's not you.
                                  
                                  Why wait?
                                  {"[color=red][bold]Take what you want.[/bold][/color]"}
                                  Wrenches. Weapons. IDs. Jetpacks. Don't ask. Don't trade. Just grab it and run.
                                  Security's lazy. Cargo's careless. Engineering leaves stuff lying around.
                                  All of it could be yours — if you're fast enough.
                                  
                                  You're not doing this to make things better.
                                  {"You're doing this because [color=red][bold]you deserve more.[/bold][/color]"}
                                  More gear. More power. More fun.
                                  
                                  {"[color=orange][bold]Sign below if you're ready to stop being poor and start taking what’s yours.[/bold][/color]"}
                                  
                                  No heroes. Just winners.
