 # Rule 0 - Don't be a dick.
 Rules can't cover every possible situation. Use your own common sense, and keep any arguments in character, not in LOOC,  ahelps, or in the lobby. Any out of character communications should be respectful and kind.

 This includes using any bugs/exploits. Please report them in the discord and using the ahelp feature.
