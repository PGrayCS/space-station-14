 # Rule 8 – Do not resort to validhunting.
 Players who are non-security should not be attempting to stop and hunt down antagonists on their own. This is a breach of a character’s logic. Security officers and ERT are assigned the job of protecting the station, and should be called whenever reasonable.

 Exceptions will be made for life or death scenarios, station-wide threats such as nuclear operatives, and self defense.
