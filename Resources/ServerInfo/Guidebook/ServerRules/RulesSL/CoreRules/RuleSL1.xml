 # Rule 1 - Admins have final say.
 Rules cannot cover every possible situation that will arise. Admins at their discretion may increase, decrease, or modify the standard punishments based on the situation. If you believe that punishment was unjustly given, you may appeal it in the discord server.

 Example(s) of this rule being broken:

 "There isn't a rule saying I can't!"

 "None of the other players had a problem with it!"

 "No one had a problem with it last time!"
