 # Rule 9 - Interacting with SSD/AFK players.
 SSD (Space Sleep Disorder) players are players who have disconnected from the game and can return to their body still. They can be identified with the yellow text upon inspection, and Zs next to their character model. AFK players are those who are unresponsive to questions or actions being taken around them.

 Being killed or robbed due to inactivity does not assist with interesting gameplay. Killing or robbing an SSD player is not interesting for either the killer or the victim. If your target is SSD, you may use ahelp to determine the best path forward.

 The basic rules for dealing with SSD/AFK players are as follows:

  - It is forbidden to touch or interact with SSD players except in the following cases: taking them to a cryo-pod, providing medical assistance, or rescuing them from immediate danger (such as carrying them out of a fire).
  - Likewise, if a player with SSD has a “Wanted” status, they may not be detained without the permission of an administrator.
  - If the player went SSD during or immediately after the detention, it is allowed to continue the detention and arrest.
  - Likewise, if you are an antagonist, and if your target has entered SSD immediately after you attacked them, you may continue.
  - If you feel compelled by the situation to interact with a player in the SSD (for example, to retrieve an important piece of equipment from a captain), use Ahelp first.
  - It is forbidden to steal a player's SSD items, except in the following cases: a mission to steal cloaks, medals, figurines and other items that are unique.
