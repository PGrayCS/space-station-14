 # Rule 4 â€“ Rules of Escalation.
 Do not randomly attack other crew members. Security also, should refer to their specific SOP on how to handle prisoners and assistants at different alert levels.

 Interactions with other players should follow similar actions to real life. Arguments with other assistants may lead to violence, however there should rarely be a reason to kill another player as a non-antagonist. Antagonists should attempt to roleplay their objectives as much as possible as well.

 Actions should start small, and all crew have the right to self defense if attacked. This may include running from security as an antagonist, however non-antagonists should not seek to seriously harm security personnel.
