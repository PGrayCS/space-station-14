  # Rule 13 - Command Member Expectations.

  Command members are to be held to a higher standard of roleplay. Command members found abusing their positions and powers will be rolebanned. Further misuse of command roles will result in a server ban, or permanent ban from all of command.

  This is especially the case for any Magistrates or NanoTrasen Representatives. Willfully violating SOP, attempting to abuse your position of power, or lying to CC will result in a permanent ban from these two roles.

  Some examples of actions that could get you punished:

   - HoP giving All Access to all passengers
   - Overly abusive department heads
   - Complete disregard for decency/SOPs
   - General LRP behavior or breaking rule 3.
