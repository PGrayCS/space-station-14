 # Rule 7 - Self-Antagonism.
 Self-antagonism is defined as acting maliciously against the station or it’s crew. Examples are included in Rule 3 also, but may include:

  - RDM
  - Directly interfering/antagonizing security with no RP reasons
  - Interfering with arrests
  - Assisting antagonists as a non-antagonist willingly

 Note: this rule does not restrict non-antagonists from actions that break Space Law. Non-antagonists are willing participants of the station, and should act as such. Roleplay may however influence a character’s decisions, such as being held at gunpoint, or life or death scenarios.


 Example(s) of reasonable in-character space law breaking:

 While facing a serious station-threatening antagonist, ordering and breaking open locked weapons crates in order to arm  yourself and others for self-defense.

 Starting a fist-fight, with no intention of killing, after a heated (in-character) argument.

 Hacking open a door you don't have access to after half the station and its crew are destroyed.

 Trespassing in somewhere you need to access to in order to do your job after waiting a long time for access to be granted to you.
