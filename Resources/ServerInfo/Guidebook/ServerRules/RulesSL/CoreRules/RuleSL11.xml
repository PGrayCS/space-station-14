 # Rule 11 - New Life.
 New Life was made so that you can continue your game on the server after the death of your character.

 However:
  - You forget everything you knew as a past character or ghost.
  - It is forbidden to abuse new life by spamming characters.
  - You may not ‘antag roll’ for antagonist slots.
