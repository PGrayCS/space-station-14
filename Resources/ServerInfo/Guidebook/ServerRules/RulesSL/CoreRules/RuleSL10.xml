 # Rule 10 â€“ Erotic Roleplay (ERP) is forbidden.
 ERP is any roleplay that includes any descriptions, mentions, or enacting of sexual acts. This includes pictures, roleplay, words, typed messages, and any other form of content. The shift should not revolve around dating, or romantic relationships between characters. Kissing and hugging are allowed, as long as their descriptions do not become graphic or extreme.

 In character insults such as those below are not included in ERP, as long as they do not become extreme.

 It is best to stay away from borderline content, but some examples of what is allowed:

 "Fuck you" - insult

 "You're a motherfucker" - insult

 "How about you eat me instead?" - Response to an unreasonable request
