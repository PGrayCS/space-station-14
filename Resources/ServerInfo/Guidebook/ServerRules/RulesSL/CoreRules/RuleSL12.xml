  # Rule 12 - Silicon.
 The Silicon Rules override all roleplay rules if there is any conflict. Silicon Rules do not override server rules. Follow rules in order, from smallest to largest number.

 Subsections to this rule:

  - You cannot request a law change, or willingly allow an unauthorized law change.
  - You must remain consistent with your interpretation of your laws.
  - ID determines who is station crew. Zombies with ID are still crew members.
