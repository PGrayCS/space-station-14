 # Rule 3 – Do not breach MRP logic.
 This Starlight server is a Medium Roleplay (MRP) project. To further this goal, you will be expected to act as if you have become your character in game. This means you should weigh your actions as your character would. Dying for instance, should be a fear of all characters, within reason. You are allowed to remember characters and their vague actions between rounds, but may not remember anything shielded by the metashield on our wiki (i.e. the existence of nuclear operatives).

 A short list of actions to avoid are listed below in no particular order. This list is NOT comprehensive.

  - Powergaming: Overly preparing for situations that have not come up yet. For instance, captain bolting his quarter’s doors shut.
  - Metagaming: Using out of game/previous knowledge to prepare/fight/effect the round, or talking about such. For instance, preparing for nuclear operatives before you could know in game.
  - In character talk in OOC chat, or vice versa during the round
  - Self-Harm/Killing: Self-killing is only allowed in the very rare circumstance that your character would have no other way out of a situation, and should not be dwelled upon.
  - End of round greifing (EORG): The round continues while at central command. You may choose to interact with OOC chat at this time.
  - RDM: Random death match, attacking players around you with no escalation or reasoning.
  - Memory loss when unconscious: Any loss of consciousness (Forced sleep, vampire trance, death, or critical state, etc.) should cause your character to only remember fuzzy details of the events. No names, specific jobs, or titles may be remembered without further investigation of the event.
