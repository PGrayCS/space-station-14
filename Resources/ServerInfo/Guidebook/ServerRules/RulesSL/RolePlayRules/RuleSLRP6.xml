 # Rule 4.6 - End of round/EORG.
 All rules work after the end of the round/manifesto/greentext (the information window at the end of the round). 
 You can not harm anyone, steal anything, break anything, or build anything detrimental, even if you are an antag. 
 All you can/should do is continue to roleplay as if nothing has changed. 
 For example, you canâ€™t Emag doors, as knowing that the round will end is metagaming.
