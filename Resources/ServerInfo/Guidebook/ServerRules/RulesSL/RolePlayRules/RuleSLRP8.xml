 # Rule 4.8 - loss of memory.
 If you go critical, die, hypnotic gaze, brain removal, or any loss of consciousness then you should not remember fine details, such as people’s names, 5 minutes leading up to the event. For example, a vampire puts you to sleep, then when you wake up you won’t know who did it.
