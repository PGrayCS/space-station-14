 # Rule 4.1 - PG, Powergame.
 Performing actions that are beyond your character's physical and psychological capabilities. Your character is a normal human being who is inherently afraid and in pain, don't forget that. You should also not hide things “just in case” and bolt doors as the head of a department unless you have been hacked before in the same round.
 This rule does not apply to large antagonists.
