 # Clarification 1 - Ahelp and Mhelp.
 Mhelp, also known as mentor help, is a way for players to ask questions about game mechanics without revealing information to other players (mostly for antags), it should only be used if the information canâ€™t be found out through IC (in character) or OOC/LOOC (out of character) means and should Not be a first resort.

 Ahelp, also known as admin help, is a way for players to talk to admins and vice versa. It should be used for matters that require admin intervention, rule clarification, or game bugs messing something up (report all bugs in the discord). Ahelp is not a place to vent, complain, or make comments about the round. If you ignore messages admins send to you via Ahelp, or disconnect during an Ahelp, It may be treated.
