#Docking and Visitors

1. The station is encouraged to allow non-hostile visitors permission to dock and embark on the station station during green alert level.

2. If a crewmember commits a crime aboard a Nanotrasen station, and then flees to an actively in-use unaffiliated vessel, asylum will be granted on the discretion of the vessel’s organization.

3. The Captain may grant or deny visitor asylum at his discretion.

4. Visitors may be granted any access the Captain deems appropriate.

5. Visitors may be assigned an escort or searched upon entrance at the Captain’s discretion.

6. At no times should the crew enter a visitor’s vessel without permission, search a visitor’s vessel, or otherwise infringe on their sovereignty.

7. Visitors aboard an NT Vessel are subject to Space Law. Likewise, if a visitor breaks the law and then immediately flees to their own vessel, the "hot pursuit" doctrine applies and security may board to detain.
