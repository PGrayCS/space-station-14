#Emergency Response Teams

1. The Emergency Shuttle is not to be called concurrently with an Emergency Response Team. Pick one or the other.

2. In the event of hostile biohazard lifeforms appearing on the station (such as deadly viruses, or Terror Spiders), Central Command is to be notified by red phone or fax before the Emergency Shuttle is called. Failure to do so may lead to the shuttle being recalled in order to enforce quarantine. CC may deny emergency shuttle requests to handle the biohazard.

3. In the event that the Emergency Shuttle is called, all personnel are to assemble at the emergency shuttle docking area at 5 minutes before arrival.

4. Forcing an early departure of the Emergency Shuttle is not permitted.

5. All personnel in critical condition are to be given emergency aid ASAP.
