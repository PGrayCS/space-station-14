# Vote of No Confidence
1. A Vote of No Confidence is a method for crew to arrange for demotions of unfit command members. An exceptional reason must be provided. Detailed below are some potential reasons for demotion.

2. Votes must be verified by a 3rd party who tabulates the votes, and additionally verifies the reasoning behind the vote. Unless involved in the dispute, the 3rd party must be the on-station Captain. If the captain is the target of the vote, central command will adjudicate the matter.

3. If the 3rd party dismisses the vote reason, the target of the vote must have their position respected, not doing so may result in a demotion for creating an abusive work environment against them. If the department is understaffed or a tie occurs, the 3rd party may be a tie breaker.

4. Votes by departmental crew against their Head of Staff must pass with a 2/3 majority in favor of the vote for it to take effect.

5. Votes by Command against their Captain must pass a simple majority in favor of the vote for it to take effect.
