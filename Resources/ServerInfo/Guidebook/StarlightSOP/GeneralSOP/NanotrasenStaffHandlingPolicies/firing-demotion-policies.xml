# Firing / Demotion Policies
1. In the case of a full dismissal, the relevant ID is to be destroyed.

2. In the case of a demotion, Civilian-level access is recommended. Alternatively, low requirement jobs such as Service Worker, Clown, or Janitor may be chosen.

3. No dismissals or demotions are to be performed without authorization from the relevant Head of Staff or Captain. See command SOP for demotions of command.

4. Personnel are to report to the Head of Personnel for dismissal/demotion. Failure to do so will lead to security detainment.

5. After a legal dismissal/demotion order is given to the person dismissed/demoted, any activity inside the previously assigned Department is to be considered Trespassing/Major Trespassing, and any item kept from said Department is to be considered Petty Theft/Theft. It is recommended that dismissed/demoted personnel willingly and quickly turn in all restricted items and cooperate to avoid detainment by security.
