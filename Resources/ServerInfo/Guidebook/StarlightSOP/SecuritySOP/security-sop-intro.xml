# Securtiy SOP

These procedures apply to all security members, unless otherwise stated in their specific SOP.

1. Armory weapons shall not be taken outside the brig on Code Green. Lethal sidearms are allowed on all alert levels (mk58, WT550, revolvers, etc.) and are not considered Armory Weapons.

2. Armory weapons will be issued on a permit basis on Code Blue, and are allowed to all Security Personnel on Code Red. Disabler SMGs are not considered armory weapons.

3. Weapons must remain holstered unless in active pursuit or on Code Red.

4. Security personnel are required to state the reason for an arrest before any action may be taken against a suspect. This does not apply on Code Red, or if a suspect flees when approached.

5. Security personnel must bring suspects to the brig uncuffed. This does not apply on Code Red, or if a suspect has already fled or become uncooperative.

6. Security personnel may not request entry to a department, unless in pursuit of a suspect, or on Code Blue or Code Red.

8. Searches may be conducted randomly on Codes Red and Blue, and on Green with an applicable warrant. Crew refusing searches on Blue/Red may be detained.

9. All Security personnel must wear at least one piece of an official Security uniform at all times. Official Security uniforms are any uniforms that are found in any security locker, or Security vendor.

10. Security personnel should refrain from wearing hardsuits or magboots unless an imminent threat or massive station damage is present.

11. Security personnel may forcefully relocate crew members to their departments on Codes Red, Violet, Yellow, or Gamma.
