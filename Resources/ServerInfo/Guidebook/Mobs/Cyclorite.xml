These intelligent inhabitants of the Abyss are emotionally reserved and have a single large eye instead of a face. They are strong but slow.

  - Their unarmed attacks deal 10 points damage with a hit rate that is 2 times slower than humans.
  - Their speed is 0.85 of that of humans.
  - They fall into a critical state at 120 points of damage.
  - They die at 240 points of damage.
  - They breathe nitrogen.
  - Due to their size, they stretch external clothing to such an extent that they can fit two tanks on their back.
  - Their eyes are less sensitive to red colors but provide better vision in the dark (shader still in development)."
