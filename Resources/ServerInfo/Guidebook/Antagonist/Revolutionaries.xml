  Revolutionaries are conversion antagonists hired by the [color=yellow]Union of Soviet Socialist Planets[/color], who are tasked with taking control over any of the stations, including [color=#5346e0]yours[/color].

  ## Objectives
  You must convert, cuff or kill all of the [textlink="Command staff" link="Command"] on station in no particular order.

  Your objective is [bold]not to destroy the station[/bold], but [italic]to take it over[/italic], so try to minimize damage where possible.

  [bold]The revolution will fail[/bold] if all of the [bold][color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionaries[/color][/bold] die, and all [color=red]Revolutionaries[/color] will de-convert if this happens.

  ## Headrevs & Conversion
  [bold][color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionaries[/color][/bold] are chosen at the start of the shift and begin with a [color=cyan]flash[/color], a pair of [color=cyan]sunglasses[/color], and an [color=#ed7300]SKB uplink implanter[/color].

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Flash"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingEyesGlassesSunglasses"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="USSPUplinkImplanter"/>
  </Box>

  You can convert crew members to your side by taking any [bold]flash[/bold] and attacking someone with it using [color=#ff0000]harm mode[/color].
  However, [bold]you can't convert your target if they're wearing [color=cyan]flash protection[/color][/bold] such as sunglasses, welding mask/goggles, or if they're a character with blind trait.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingEyesWeldingGoggles"/>
  </Box>

  Another obstacle in your way are those pesky brainwashing [color=cyan]mindshield implanters[/color]. 

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MindShieldImplanter"/>
  </Box>

  These will:
  - Prevent the implanted person from being converted into a [color=red]Revolutionary[/color]
  - De-convert Revolutionaries, and will make them no longer loyal to your cause
  - [bold]Visibly be destroyed upon being implanted into a [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionary[/color][/bold], giving you away
  - NOT protect against flash disorientation

  Assume all of [color=#cb0000]Security[/color], [color=#1b67a5]Command[/color] and [color=#a86819]Salvage specialists[/color] to be implanted with mindshields already, [bold]however they can be removed using an empty implanter, obtainable from the Medical department's MedFab, or in your [color=#ed7300]uplink.[/color][/bold]

  ## Svyaz-UZL uplink (Telebonds & Total Conversion)

  [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionaries[/color] start additionally with an [color=#ed7300]SKB uplink implanter[/color], which can be implanted into them or in a [color=red]Revolutionary[/color] [bold]converted by them specifically.[/bold]

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="USSPUplinkImplanter"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BaseRevUplinkRadio"/>
  </Box>

  The subdermal uplink allows purchase of various [bold]global limited stocks[/bold] of weapons and tools for the revolution via [bold][color=#5c5c5c]Telebonds[/color][/bold] and [bold][color=#e3a736]Total Conversion.[/color][/bold]

  - [bold][color=#5c5c5c]Telebonds[/color][/bold], much like [color=red]Telecrystals[/color] are a individual private currency obtainable from [bold]conversion[/bold], that are each specific to each [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionary[/color].
  - [bold][color=#e3a736]Total Conversion[/color][/bold], apart from showing how many crew members have been converted, is a [bold]global unspendable currency shared among all [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionaries[/color][/bold]. Which are mainly used in the [bold]GLOBAL[/bold] section of the uplink, allowing you to place things like the [color=yellow]supply rift[/color].

  The uplink stocks are shared among all who use the uplink, and additionally it shows who has last purchased the item.

  ## Supply Rift

  Upon reaching [bold]20 total conversions[/bold], you will be able to place a [color=yellow]supply rift[/color], which will drop soviet supplies every 35 seconds.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CrateSovietArmaments" Caption="500 crates"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="WeaponSniperMosin" Caption="Mass Assault"/>
  </Box>

  The [color=yellow]rift[/color] will [bold]secretly inform all [color=red]revolutionaries[/color] in the chat of it's location[/bold] upon spawn.

  At 50% charge, the station [bold]will be alerted of an energy influx[/bold], thus [bold]exposing you[/bold] at the cost of infinite supplies in the long run.

  If a [color=yellow]rift[/color] is destroyed, you won't be able to place another one. And you'll only be able to place another if the [bold]current one is charged.[/bold]

  It is recommended to discuss early on in the round where you'll place the [color=yellow]rift[/color] with your [color=red]revolutionaries[/color] so that they can [bold]fortify[/bold] the area to prevent [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] from [bold]destroying[/bold] it.
  
  ## Antagonist Roles
  A [color=red]Revolutionary[/color] is a crew member that has been converted by a [bold][color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionary[/color][/bold].

  [bold][color=red]Revolutionaries[/color] can't convert people themselves,[/bold] but they're more than capable of doing dirty work, carrying out orders, or distribute supplies if [bold]they were implanted with [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionary's SKB uplink.[/color][/bold]

  ## Tips

  As a [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionary[/color], it's recommended that:
  - You [bold]convert[/bold] people away from public spaces. Apart from being potentially seen by the [color=#70a7ff]Station AI[/color], flash and knockdowns are loud and it can be heard by anyone not loyal to you. Out of public conversions are best done by a [color=blue]Paramedic[/color].

  </Box>

  - It's very beneficial in the long-run to start as one or convert [color=#f5be51]Cargo/Mail Technicians[/color] and [color=#a319ff]Scientists[/color], due to their sufficient ability to [bold]stop incoming orders of mindshields[/bold] or to [bold]provide you with flashes made from an [color=blue]Exosuit Fabricator[/color][/bold], respectively.

  </Box>

  - [bold][color=#5c5c5c]Telebonds[/color][/bold] can be withdrawn and shared among all who use the [color=#ed7300]uplink[/color]. As such, if you want to purchase [bold]one of the more expensive items[/bold], it's best to meet with your [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionaries[/color] later on in the round if no prior [bold][color=#5c5c5c]Telebonds[/color][/bold] purchases were made.

  As a [color=red]Revolutionary[/color], it's recommended that:

  - You protect your [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionary[/color] at all costs. Protect them from [color=red]the law[/color], by trading IDs and goods so that they can make their escapes.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CargoIDCard" Caption="Potentially Wanted ID"/>
  </Box>

  - If a [color=yellow]supply rift[/color] was placed, you [bold]will be secretly informed of it's location[/bold]. So do your best and provide help when possible.

  - If you know where the [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionaries[/color] will place the [color=yellow]rift[/color] beforehand, you can help reinforcing the area.

  - And lastly, have fun. As long as it helps the revolution without severly damaging the station.
